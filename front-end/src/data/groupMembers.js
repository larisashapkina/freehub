 description: `Through out my career in social services and in the food industry I saw a common problem outdated technology. Companies had to pay outside parties to either get new software or develop a new system. I became very attracted to how technology was changing and innovating the workforce which is why I decided to take the leap into a new career to pursue software engineering. I am now a full time fellow at Pursuit were I am becoming a software engineer. The lack of women of color in the industry has inspired me to continue to become successful in this new career.`,

description: `Becoming a full-stack web developer is directly related to my obsession with marrying music and technology,
 along with the rabbit hole that is my startup-ConcertMagnet. My love affair with music and its industry, however, started 
 at a very young age. I've been blessed enough to work intermittently in music at Electric Lady Studios and with managers 
 who've handled some of the most revered artists in the world.  Post earning Google's Project Management Certification and 
 acquiring the title of SCRUM Master, my goals are to build things that make the music industry more prosperous, while hand-in-hand, 
 funding causes that create harmony between man, animals, and the environment.`,
